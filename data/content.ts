  landlordTestimonial: {
    title: "Current Landlord Recommendation",
    content: "Kris operates a corporate housing company and has consistently demonstrated professionalism, reliability, and strong communication throughout his tenancy. He maintains the property to an excellent standard, has never missed or delayed a rental payment, and has been respectful of all community and property rules. His team ensures that the property remains clean, well-managed, and in great condition at all times. Unlike many of my other one-year tenants, Kris has consistently demonstrated a higher level of responsibility and care for the property. While I was initially hesitant about his business model, it has proven to be both dependable and professionally managed time and again. As a landlord, I've appreciated Kris's transparent and proactive approach. He keeps open lines of communication, addresses any maintenance issues swiftly, and consistently ensures that the property is used responsibly and with care. I have full confidence in recommending Kris Mathew as a tenant for any future property. His business operations reflect a high degree of integrity and professionalism, and I would be glad to work with him again.",

The place was clean and we loved being able to visit the local parks, museums, restaurants and more. Host was responsive to any questions and the amenities were fantastic. I would have no problem coming back to any machines... you feel right at home. Would recommend. Thanks for allowing our visit to Dallas be stress free!"

    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What happens if my home is damaged?",
        answer: "Your property is protected with two layers of insurance for added peace of mind. Every guest is held responsible for damages, and we perform routine inspections to catch issues early. With our in-house cleaning and maintenance teams, your home is consistently monitored and cared for. In practice, damage beyond normal wear and tear is very rare."
      },
      {
        question: "How are guests screened? I don't want just anyone entering my home.",
        answer: "Most guests are already vetted through their employers or placement services. In addition, we partner with a trusted third-party verification company to run background and identity checks. We also prioritize the peace of mind of neighbors and the surrounding community by using exterior Ring cameras and noise decibel devices to ensure responsible guest behavior."
      },
      {
        question: "How long of a lease are you looking for?",
        answer: "We aim to build long-term partnerships with property owners. Most agreements range from 1–4+ years, with a preference for at least 2 years. This reduces turnover and gives you stability, though we're always open to discussing terms on a case-by-case basis."
      },
      {
        question: "Will there be any pets?",
        answer: "We love pets, however to maintain the condition of your property and avoid unnecessary risk, we do not allow pets in our managed homes."
      },
      {
        question: "What does property management cost?",
        answer: "We operate on a fixed rent model. You receive the agreed rent amount without any additional fees, management costs, or hidden charges."
      },
      {
        question: "How often am I paid, and what about utilities?",
        answer: "Owners are paid monthly, always on time. We handle utility coordination to keep operations seamless — no surprises or late bills."
